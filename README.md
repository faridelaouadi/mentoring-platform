Background and Motivation
------

- This web app is made using bootstrap (frontend), Python Flask (backend) and the SQLALchemy ORM to interact with the PostgreSQL database.

- This platform will soon be launched at my univeristy for the arab + north african society to connect alumni students with current students in a mentor/mentee arrangement. This platform will also help with networking as students can browse through and contact all users. And finally it will be beneficial to students as they share resources on the resources section.
